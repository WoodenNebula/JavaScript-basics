# JavaScript _(YavaScript)_
>The bane of all web programming

Aspiring to be a programmer without having dipped your toes into web development seems to be impossible. 
And as such, I decided to try getting a taste of this everyone's "favourite" programming langauge - JavaScript

I plan on learning JavaScript along with concepts of web development as a part of my commitment to LeapFrog's 60 Days of Learning.
This requires me to be posting my daily progress in [Twitter](https://x.com/WoodenNebula). I am hoping to learn at least the bare bones of web development during this period.

<br>

## Resource Following
I will mostly be following this book named [ELOQUENT JAVASCRIPT](https://eloquentjavascript.net) throughout the learning period along with any other resource on YouTube and internet at times.

## Learning Goals
- Make JavaScript my mother tongue
- Cover basics of HTML and CSS
- Node.js
- Learn a few widely used framework and libraries (looking at you React)
- Learn about SQL and NoSQL database
- APIs
  
And Most Importantly
- **Develop a discipline on learning and commitment to a task**

## Progress Tracking
The commit messages will act as a summary for each day on what I learnt for the day, each commit starting with the Day Number followed by a summarized commit mmessage.
Detailed log of what I learnt for the day will be posted in the twitter feed along with screenshots of any new diffs in the code. The images wont be tracked here but a link to each day's post will be maintained along with a summary in tabular basis below. Hopefully, I will have automated the process of linking the new tweet by the end of this learning period.
